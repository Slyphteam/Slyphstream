#this is an ENTIRELY NONFUNCTIONAL script that just contains what I have or haven't done yet
#NEEDS DOING (in presumed  order of precedence):
#sort out sourelike midair
#figure out and get rid of whatever's causing the jitteriness
#mouse integration
#fine-tuning to make it feel like gmod

# DIRECTORY OF WHERE SHIT IS:
# playertry2 is the ACTUAL implemented code that does things
# playerinput, playershared, and player_phys are all (mostly) copypasted from
# the godot3 and godot4 sourcelike projects people have worked on
