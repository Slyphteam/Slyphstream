this is an ENTIRELY NONFUNCTIONAL script

DIRECTORY OF WHERE SHIT IS:

 the MOST important scripts are as follow:
 --scripts/player/held_weapon_behavior: acts as a data instance for the held weapon
 -- scripts/player/invenManager (NOT invnetorymanager): Tracking ammunition and communicating 
	with the player/held item
 --scripts/player/playermovementinput: Kinematic controller for the player, input/output

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

--KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-- it's REALLY hard to jump up on a platform (is it?)
-- players can't "step" up a ledge, no matter how small
-- weapons jitter while player is holding movement keys on floor


NEEDS DOING (in presumed order of precedence):
 Step up/down movement code
get better pistol gunshot
footstep sounds
ADS makes the camesa zoom in
inaccuracy with the dynamic recoil system
crosshair changes with speed
context-sensitive leaning
ammo pickups
weapon switching
fix weapon clipping (but do i really care that much ?)
KICKING!!!
