DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:

 the MOST important scripts are as follow:
 --scripts/player/held_weapon_behavior: acts as a data instance for the held weapon
 -- scripts/player/invenManager (NOT inveNtorymanager): Tracking ammunition and communicating 
	with the player/held item
 --scripts/player/playermovementinput: Kinematic controller for the player, input/output

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

--KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-- it's REALLY hard to jump up on a platform (is it?)
-- players can't "step" up a ledge, no matter how small
-- weapons jitter while player is holding movement keys on floor (caused by move and slide, presumably)


NEEDS DOING:
KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant

inaccuracy with the dynamic recoil system (integrate with the get_end function) -*

player interact raycase (important for ammo pickups, sylph testing, yada yada big importance) -*
from above: ammo pickups ++++
footstep sounds +++
Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)
get better pistol gunshot &++
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
crosshair changes with speed **
context-sensitive leaning --&

fix weapon clipping ++++++++ &
KICKING!!!
