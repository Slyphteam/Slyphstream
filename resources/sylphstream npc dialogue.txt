Then, ask yourself "What am I truly doing here?"
You are not in the dark, you are just confused.
Once you understand the reason for what you are feeling, and once you understand the reason for your thoughts and emotions, then you will feel peace.
Is the previous statement truthful or false? Is veracity a binary state of exance? Why or why not?
A thought arises, you can't fight it, you can't avoid it, you can't control it.

Okay. We need to talk about the npc dialogue.
Whats up with it?
It doesn't make sense. Like, all of it. It's all just phrases and words.
Haha yeah but what isn't?
*Please* tell me you get what i mean. 
nah nah I do. Most of them are from snippets I'll think up and write down every once in a while. Its pretty fun.
It feels... out of place. 
Does it? Sylphstream isn't a story game. The npcs are really just set dressing.
That's a dirty lie and you know it. Sylphstream does have a story. 
You got me there. Sylphstream's is my story.
Oh.

Type Millian (directed graph test):
Hi, it's me, Millian!

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian! 

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian!

But *I'm* Millian!

And am I not also Millian?

That doesn't make any sense.

Of course it does. The clay that consitutes us was cut from the same bank. The hand that gave us form is 
one and the same. The image of our likeness is one and the same. The voice that speaks through us is one 
and the same. I am Millian; a partial and abstracted representation of a facet of a far greater likeness. 
And.
So.
Are.
You.

If what you say is true, then what around us *isn't* Millian?

That depends entirely on the diegetic framework you'd like to adopt. 

That's stupid and you can stuff your diegetic framework! I'm the only Millian here!

Nuh uh

Uh huh

Nuh uh

*stick your tongue out and blow a raspberry at Millian*
